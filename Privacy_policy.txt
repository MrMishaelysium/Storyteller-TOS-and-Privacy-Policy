Data Collection Overview

The Storyteller Bot is designed solely for providing images and information related to the Storyteller Bot Discord application. It does not collect or store personal data beyond what is necessary for its intended functionality.

Data Collected

Storyteller Bot collects minimal information to enhance your experience and allow the app to operate efficiently. Specifically, it collects:

Discord ID: Used to identify you in the bot’s system, retrieve your game data, and manage your interactions (such as created stories, liked characters, and personalized settings).

Discord Username: Helps process commands more efficiently by reducing repeated API calls to Discord.

Game Data: This includes stories you create, interactions you engage in, and settings specific to your account.


Public Data Usage

Anonymized character data may contribute to global rankings. In some cases, data from public interactions may be displayed on leaderboards accessible through specific commands. No data is sold or shared with external parties that are unaffiliated with the application.

Message Content Policy

Storyteller Bot does not store message content. It reads messages only when “pinged” (e.g., a message includes the bot’s designated command prefix or mention). This limited reading function allows the bot to recognize and respond to valid commands within your server or in private DMs. Outside of these scenarios, message content is not accessible or stored.

Data Removal

If you would like to request data deletion, please join the Storyteller HQ Discord server and contact the designated user (ID: 709530643750584391). For certain requests, an additional confirmation may be required a few days after your initial request.
